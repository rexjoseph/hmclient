    question: "When can I expect to receive my packages?",
    answer: "Packages are usually delivered between 7-15 days. If it indicates 'ships between 1-2' business days, it does not mean you will get it on a certain day, just that it will be shipped within 1-2 business days. What the postal service does with it after that will determine how quickly you receive your item. If anything comes up, we'll do well to reach out in a timely manner."

    question: "Do you have a return policy?",
    answer: "Yes. It's available here"

    question: "Can I cancel an order after 24hrs?",
    answer: "Unfortunately, no. We only allow cancellations within 24 hours after order confirmation."
  },

    question: "Do you ship worldwide?",
    answer: "Yes. We ship worldwide. Alternatively, you can let us know beforehand if you need us to ship to a US, Europe address even if you don't live there and we'll handle your package to make sure they get delivered."
