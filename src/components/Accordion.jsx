    question: "When can I expect to receive my packages?",
    answer: "Packages are usually delivered between 7-15 days. If it indicates 'ships between 1-2' business days, it does not mean you will get it on a certain day, just that it will be shipped within 1-2 business days. What the postal service does with it after that will determine how quickly you receive your item. If anything comes up, we'll do well to reach out in a timely manner."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you have a return policy?",
    answer: "Yes. It's available here"
  },
  {
    question: "Can I cancel an order after 24hrs?",
    answer: "Unfortunately, no. We only allow cancellations within 24 hours after order confirmation."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you ship worldwide?",
    answer: "Yes. We ship worldwide. Alternatively, you can let us know beforehand if you need us to ship to a US, Europe address even if you don't live there and we'll handle your package to make sure they get delivered."
  },
  {
    question: "Where can I see tracking numbers?",
    answer: "Tracking information is sent out by email and available in the order history section of your dashboard. Please allow 2 business days to receive your tracking number"
  },
  {
    question: "How can I initiate a return?",
    answer: "You can initiate a return from the order page on your dashboard. Have your order ID ready, open the live chat, call or send an e-mail to help@hashingmart.com"
  },
  {
    question: "Why are my packages shipped separately?",
    answer: "This is to provide you with fast delivery and prevent us from being packed up."
  },
  {
    question: "Will I get charged for taxes and customs or any hidden charges?",
    answer: "No. Your order quote during checkout is all you pay. That's right. No hidden charges."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if my package gets lost in transit?",
    answer: "All packages are sent with insured shipping and handling. If a package gets stuck at customs, sent back or even lost during the delivery process, we apologize. The postal service is out of our control. However, in cases like this, because the packages are insured, we will send you a new package, if possible. Please see our refund and return policy for when these might be applicable."
